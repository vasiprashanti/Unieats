# Unieats

**Unieats** is a web-based food ordering and delivery platform designed for **in-campus** and **in-hostel** use at Manipal University Jaipur. Inspired by platforms like Zomato and Swiggy, Unieats focuses on streamlining the ordering process for students, enabling them to browse menus, place orders, track deliveries, and make secure payments â€” all in one place.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Background

Unieats was originally launched in **2021** as the first platform of its kind. It operated successfully for a year and even received a purchase offer of â‚¹5 lakhs from faculty members, which was declined. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the platform was paused but is now being rebuilt from the ground up with improved features, UI/UX, and scalability.
